# InterviewMate ü§ñ

InterviewMate is an AI-powered mock interview platform that helps job seekers enhance their technical and behavioral interview skills through realistic simulations, personalized feedback, and detailed performance analysis.

## üéØ Overview

InterviewMate leverages advanced AI technology to create dynamic interview experiences. Built with Python backend, React frontend, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, it provides tailored interview scenarios based on candidates' resumes and target job roles. The platform utilizes the Gemini API for human-like interactions and incorporates emotion recognition for comprehensive feedback.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four main layers:
- User Interface Layer: Handles speech-to-text, text-to-speech, document input, and report generation
- Backend Processing Layer: Manages data preprocessing, storage, and feature extraction
- RAG Pipeline: Implements intelligent question generation and contextual response handling
- Response Generation: Creates personalized, context-aware interview interactions
